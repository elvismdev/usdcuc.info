  <p>Similar to how you would do it from your browser, <strong>USDCUC.info</strong> search the last 100 ads listed in the currency purchase and sale category on <strong>revolico.com</strong> that contain the word <em>USD</em> and within the price range of <em>$0 - $2</em> CUC.</p>

  <p>Then, add up all the prices of each ad and divide that total by 100 to get a unique average price.</p>

  <p><code>SUM( $prices ) / TOTAL( $ads ) = $average</code></p>

  <p>This simple algorithm based on the most recent announcements of Revolico, allows to visualize on what price the change of the CUC vs USD is currently in the Cuban informal market <em>(the street)</em>.</p>
